### Purpose of the repo

To give people with no understanding of vim and quick way to pick up useful motions and commands.
When I started using Vim a couple of years ago, I found it difficult to get started.

Recently, I've managed to become really productive with it since I've learned the basic motions and expanded on them.

Don't try to take everything in at once and don't be scared to use the official help system in vim.

The help system can be overwhelming if you are reading from cover to cover but pick a small piece to learn,
go and learn that bit fluently and then move onto the next section.

Consistency is key to learning vim and it's a totally different way of doing things if you are coming from
a Jetbrains or VScode world.

### Important things to understand

- Do most of the work in normal mode. It's faster than working in insert mode.
  Only use insert mode when typing new text.
- Master the difference between tabs, windows and buffers. Knowing how to use
  tabs properly will save loads of time with navigation throughout different
  sections of your project.
- Master the difference between normal and visual mode. - You don't need multi
  cursor like in VScode if you know how to use visual mode and macros.
